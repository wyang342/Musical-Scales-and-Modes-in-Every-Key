# Musical-Scales-and-Modes-in-Every-Key
This WOLFRAM Demonstration lets users listen to a large selection of musical scales and modes by clicking the appropriate labeled button. When you select the "key" button, the scales are transposed to that key. The scales are grouped into rows: the first row contains major and minor scales, the second row contains hexatonic scales, the third row contains scales used in specific music genres, the fourth row contains modes, and the final row contains scales that did not fit into the above categories. Using this Demonstration, musicians may learn to recognize different scales and modes in every key when away from an instrument.
